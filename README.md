=SpheroVoice=

This is a proof of concept voice command app for the Sphero, specifically the SPRK+. I have not tested any other systems.

Google Voice code from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4975443/is-there-a-way-to-use-the-speechrecognizer-api-directly-for-speech-input
Sphero connecting code from: https://github.com/orbotix/Sphero-Android-SDK/tree/beta/samples/HelloWorld
	- NOTE: You must use the BETA branch as of 2016-11-30 to make it compatable with the SPRK+
	
I do not plan on maintaining this project.
